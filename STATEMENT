## Problem Statement  
Design and develop a simple yet effective **To-Do List Application** in Python that allows users to manage daily tasks and visually track their productivity through a pie chart showing completed vs pending tasks.

## Scope of the Project  
This is a **console-based mini project** developed as part of the **First-Year Python Programming coursework** at VIT Bhopal. It focuses on implementing fundamental programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, user input handling, and basic data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Target Users  
- Students learning Python (especially first-year engineering students)  
- Anyone looking for a lightweight, beginner-level task management tool  
- VIT Bhopal faculty & peers reviewing mini-project submissions
